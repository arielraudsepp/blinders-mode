* blinders-mode

=blinders-mode= is a minor mode to limit the amount of lines displayed on a buffer. It works similarly to a reading guide, which is a plastic strip with the see-through strip placed over the line you want to read. This can help with a various reading problems by reducing the amount of visual information. I created it after having a concussion to help with headaches.

** Installation
You can install =blinders-mode= from source
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
    cd /path/for/elisp-packages
    git clone https://github.com/arielraudsepp/blinders-mode
#+END_SRC

and then add to your load path and you're all set!
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (add-to-list 'load-path' "path/to/blinders-mode")
    (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'blinders-mode)
#+END_SRC

Or,
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package blinders-mode
 :straight (:host github :repo "arielraudsepp/blinders-mode"))
#+END_SRC

If you're using Doom Emacs, add the following to packages.el
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
